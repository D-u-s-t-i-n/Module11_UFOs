# Challenge Notes
The challenge expands the single filter javascript to multi (5) filters. 

The project flow is as follows:
- Initialize the table with the data (from data.js)
- Call the updateFilter function which loops through the textfields.
-- If the field is blank, do not add to the filters

Through this challenge, the following lessons were learned:
- Difference between objects and arrays
- Apply foreach in objects
